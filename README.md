Python Learning README
Overview
This README provides a structured roadmap for beginners to learn Python effectively in 2025, focusing on free resources, key milestones, and hands-on practice. It draws from proven 30-day to 12-month plans that build skills progressively from basics to projects.​

Step 1: Setup and Basics (Days 1-7)
Install Python from the official site and use IDLE or VS Code for coding. Master core syntax including variables, data types (integers, strings, lists, dictionaries), conditionals (if/elif/else), and loops (for/while). Practice with simple scripts like calculators or games.​

Step 2: Intermediate Skills (Days 8-21)
Learn functions, modules (math, random), data structures, file handling, and error handling with try-except. Introduce object-oriented programming concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. Build mini-projects to apply these skills.​

Step 3: Advanced Topics and Projects (Days 22+)
Explore OOP fully, algorithms, testing, databases, and specialization paths like web development (Flask/Django), data science (pandas), or automation. Use Git/GitHub for version control and create portfolios with real projects
